		<h2>Terms of Service</h3>
			<h3>What is a pre-existing condition?</h3>
				<p>A pre-existing condition means that the condition first occurred or showed clinical signs or symptoms (there doesn't need to be a diagnosis) before your cat's coverage started, including waiting periods. The Healthy Paws plan excludes pre-existing conditions from coverage as do all pet insurance providers.</p>
		
		<br>
		
			<h3>What is not covered?</h3>
				<p>Meow and Moew services plan is all about protecting your cat from the unexpected and you from the financial problems their treatment may cause. The cat insurance plan doesn't cover pre-existing conditions, the examination fee, or preventative care, such as annual check-ups, vaccinations, spay/neuter procedures and teeth cleaning</p>
